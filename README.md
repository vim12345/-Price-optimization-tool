# -Price-optimization-tool

# Description:
A price optimization tool helps businesses determine the ideal price point for products to maximize revenue or profit. In this project, we simulate a dataset of product prices and sales, and build a regression model to understand the price-demand relationship and identify the optimal price for maximum revenue.

# ðŸ’¡ What This Project Demonstrates:
* Simulates price vs demand and calculates revenue

* Builds a linear model to estimate the price-demand curve

* Identifies the optimal price that maximizes predicted revenue

* Visualizes the revenue curve and optimal price point
